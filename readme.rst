Description :
The application is about the educational loan for students who are struggling to get their loan on time in public bank in india.
PROBLEM :
Though Government of India giving more favours towards students educational loan, the time interval for the loan application process are too long to be sanctioned or to know either its approved or ignored.So students are worried about the loan processing time in government bank because they need to pay or show their loan amount to proceed to their desired University within the period of time.So many students are not able to proceed loans from government banks even though government favours low rate of interest.So they have no other option to go for the private banks ,who does the process within a week but they give too much of rate of interest for students education loan which will be catastrophic burden to repay their debt.
PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Building this web application,the process will be simpler to track their educational loan from Government.Student can enter their details about the course,university and their study destination and they can easily upload their academic records and their assets by the scanned copy  to this portal which will be verified directly by the zonal office of their desired banks instead of submitting the hard copies  to their home bank and migrating the documents to the zonal office and their eligibility   will be known within a week.
